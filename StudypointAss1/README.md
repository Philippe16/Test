# Assignment 1

### 1.1 SHOOTING
A woman fired a shot at a man with her gun, but the man did not die. List the possible
reasons for the man not dying.

- Non fatal shot. The shot hit a bodypart that is not fatal for the victim.

- Missed vital organs. No vital organs where hit or came in contanct with the bullet.

- Bodyarmor. The victim was using some sort of bodyamor to block the bullet.

- Distance from the shooter. The distances from shooter to victim was large, so the bullet lost speed.

- Bullet deflection. The bullet was deflected either by something the victim was holding or wearing.

- By pure luck. The victim didn't die to the bullet only by pure luck.


### 1.2 ALIEN
An alien meets you and it asks you to teach it how to brush its teeth. Assume that the
alien has teeth exactly like yours, and is as smart as you, but it needs a clear step-bystep instruction. List the steps. Be as detailed as you can. (Example: Hold the
toothpaste with your left hand; turn the cap
anti-clockwise)

Materials Needed:

A toothbrush
Toothpaste
A cup or glass of clean water


1. Gather toothbrush, toothpaste, and a cup or glass of clean water.
2. Hold the toothbrush under running water to moisten the bristles. This will help toothpaste to work more effecient.
3. Squeeze a small amount of toothpaste onto the bristle of the toothbrush.
4. Hold the toothbrush in your dominant hand and grib the handle firmly.
5. Place the toothbrush bristles against your teeth, starting with the upper back side on one side.
6. Tilt the brush at a slight angle towards your gum line
7. Using gentle, circular motions, brush the outer surfaces of your teeth and gums. Make sure to brush each teeth.
8. Brush the inner surfaces of your teeth as well. For the upper front teeth, brush in a vertical motion.
9. Brush your tongue, the roof of your mouth, and the insides of your cheeks to remove bacteria and freshen your breath.
10. Keep brushing your teeth for atleast 2 minutes.
11. After brushing, spit out the toothpaste and any debris into the sink.
12. Rinse your mouth with water from the cup or glass. Swish it around in your mouth and then spit it out. This helps remove any remaining toothpaste and debris.
13. Rinse the toothbrush under running water to remove any remaining toothpaste and debris.
14. Place your toothbrush in an upright position to air dry.
15. Clean up after you.




### 3. GIVE YOUR THOUGHTS ON TDD 

**Test-Driven Development (TDD) Reflection**

**Positive Aspects of TDD**

Writing testable and maintainable code. The process of writing tests before implementing the code forces you to think about edge cases and potential issues upfront, leading to better code quality.

TDD also provides a safety net for code changes. When you make modifications to your codebase, you can rerun your tests to ensure that existing functionality remains intact. This confidence in your code's stability is a significant benefit.

It gives you a deeper understanding of the problem, domain and requirements. You need to think about the expected behavior, which often leads to clearer and more accurate implementations.

Tests act as living documentation for your code. They serve as examples of how your code should be used and can help other developers understand your codebase quickly.

Last, TDD can help identify and fix issues early in the development process. When a test fails, it's often easier to pinpoint the problem because you know exactly what functionality is affected.

**Challenges and Annoyances of TDD**

Developers thare are new to TDD, can be met with a learning curve. Understanding how to structure tests, write effective assertions, and choose appropriate testing frameworks can take some time.

Writing tests before implementing features can feel slower initially, especially when deadlines are tight. However, the time saved later in debugging and maintaining code often outweighs this initial slowdown.

In some cases, there may be a tendency to over-test, writing tests for every trivial piece of code. Finding the right balance can be challeging.

**Surprising Aspects of TDD**

TDD often leads to better code design. Writing tests first encourages you to think about how your code will be used and how it fits into the larger architecture. This can lead to more modular and extensible code.

Contrary to the misconception that TDD restricts creativity, it can actually encourage creative problem-solving. By forcing you to think deeply about requirements and constraints, you may come up with innovative solutions.

**TDD's Impact on Test Coverage**

TDD encourages comprehensive test coverage. It's common to write tests for edge cases and scenarios that might be overlooked in traditional development. This results in more robust and reliable software.

TDD often leads to the creation of tests for scenarios that might be missed in a non-TDD approach. Since you start by thinking about requirements, you're more likely to cover a wider range of cases.

- In conclusion, TDD is a powerful software development methodology that, while initially challenging, offers numerous benefits in terms of code quality, confidence in changes, and improved understanding of requirements. It can help uncover issues early and encourages a more deliberate and thoughtful approach to coding. While there are challenges and a learning curve, the long-term advantages make TDD a valuable practice in modern software development.
